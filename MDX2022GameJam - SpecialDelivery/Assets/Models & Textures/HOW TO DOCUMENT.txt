Hello Designer! :)

In this folder i have attached PNGs of materials needed to texture the 3D models

This process will need to be done in unity

1. Import the 3D model into unity (the ones you already have) along with the Material PNGs 

2. Right click > Create > Material

3. Open the New material inspector and locate ''Albedo''

4. Drag the material to the Albedo box, this should now show a textured material in the project files

5. Drag the appropriate created Material from the project files to the 3D object in the Unity Editor and this should texture the 3D object

6: Repeat process for other 3D objects in Unity


I have found this method is the only way that is working currently and sorry for any inconvinience. Please ping me for any issues arising
